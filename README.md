DOCUMENT TITLE:
Prospera Ontology Engine & Knowledge Modeling Specification

DOCUMENT TYPE:
Knowledge Architecture Specification (Class K)

DOCUMENT ID:
SPN-L1-ONT-PLAT-001

VERSION:
v1.1.0

STATUS:
Active / Semantic Locked

OWNER:
Prospera Engineering Governance Council / SME Knowledge Board

CREATED DATE:
2026-03-24

APPLICABLE SCOPE:
Worldview Modeling · SME Knowledge Graphs · Consulting Reasoning Logic

====================================================================

1. PURPOSE

This document establishes the Prospera Ontology Engine as the 
authoritative knowledge modeling layer of the ecosystem. It defines 
the "Prospera Worldview"—the semantic structure and relationship 
rules required to power business intelligence, consulting reasoning, 
and Subject Matter Expert (SME) knowledge graphs within Prospera OS.

====================================================================

2. SEMANTIC ROLES (NORMATIVE)

- R-01 [SEMANTIC_MOTHER]: This engine SHALL be the sole source for 
  defining the relationship between system entities (e.g., Actor, 
  Action, Authority, Goal).
- R-02 [KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH]: It MUST provide the canonical mapping for 
  SME domain expertise, ensuring that AI reasoning remains aligned 
  with verified professional logic.
- R-03 [REASONING_CONSTRAINTS]: It MUST supply the semantic axioms 
  required by the `prospera-generation-layer` to prevent logical 
  hallucinations and ensure "Governed Reasoning."

====================================================================

3. SYSTEM INVARIANTS (NON-VIOLABLE)

- I-01: ONTOLOGICAL_CONSISTENCY: No new semantic class or relationship 
  MAY be introduced if it contradicts the root taxonomy defined in the 
  `MOTHER_MAP.yaml`.
- I-02: TAXONOMY_LOCKED: Base classes (e.g., GOVERNOR, WORKER, ASSET) 
  are immutable at runtime. Any extension MUST be approved via 
  an MND-level Governance Amendment.
- I-03: TRACEABILITY: Every node in the knowledge graph MUST be 
  traceable back to a specific rule or standard in the `Engineering Codex`.

====================================================================

4. FAILURE MODES & SEMANTIC DRIFT

- F-01: Semantic Drift -> Any reasoning output that deviates from the 
  Ontology Invariants MUST be flagged as "LOGICALLY_INVALID."
- F-02: Circular Definition -> Automated detection and rejection of 
  any SME model that introduces recursive authority loops.
- F-03: Worldview Conflict -> Mandatory "HARD_HALT" on the AI Reasoner 
  until the semantic conflict is resolved by a Human Auditor.

====================================================================

5. USAGE RESTRICTION

Execution layers (L4/L5) SHALL NOT modify the Ontology. They MAY only 
query the established Knowledge Graphs to inform their deterministic 
execution paths.
